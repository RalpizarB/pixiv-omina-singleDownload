# Cookie File Format

This file should contain your Pixiv cookies in the following format:

```
cookie_name1=cookie_value1; cookie_name2=cookie_value2; cookie_name3=cookie_value3
```

## How to Get Your Cookies

### Method 1: Using Browser Developer Tools

1. Open your browser and log in to Pixiv (https://www.pixiv.net)
2. Press F12 to open Developer Tools
3. Go to the "Application" or "Storage" tab
4. Click on "Cookies" â†’ "https://www.pixiv.net"
5. Copy all cookies in the format: `name=value; name=value; ...`

### Method 2: Export from Browser Extension

Use a cookie export extension to export all pixiv.net cookies.

## Required Cookies

At minimum, you need the session cookie (usually named `PHPSESSID`). Example:

```
PHPSESSID=your_session_id_here
```

For better compatibility, include all Pixiv cookies:

```
PHPSESSID=12345_abcdef; privacy_policy_agreement=1; privacy_policy_notification=0; __cf_bm=xyz123
```

## Important Notes

- Keep this file private and secure (it contains your authentication data)
- The file is already in .gitignore to prevent accidental commits
- Cookies expire after some time - you may need to update them periodically
- One cookie per line OR all cookies on one line separated by semicolons

## Example Format

Single line format (recommended):
```
cookie1=value1; cookie2=value2; cookie3=value3
```

Or multi-line format:
```
cookie1=value1
cookie2=value2
cookie3=value3
```

Both formats work - the script will parse either correctly.
