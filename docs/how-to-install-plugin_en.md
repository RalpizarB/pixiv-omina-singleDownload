# How to install plugin

> Take the folder [Example](https://github.com/leoding86/pixiv-omina/tree/master/plugin_example) in the repository as an example of plugin.

1. Download the folder `Example` to any location you like 
2. Copy the downloaded folder `Example` to the `plugins` folder of the `Pixiv Omina` installation folder (if there is no `plugins` folder, create a new one manually)
3. Restart the application
4. After restart, open the plugins list (the button at the right bottom edge of the `Pixiv Omina` window) to check whether the plugin is installed successfully.
